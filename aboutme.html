        <p>If your reading this then you want to know more about me and, it's really none of you business but, if you
            must know then keep reading.
            I am a very enthusiastic open minded free spirit. I love playing video games, trying new recipes, and
            reading.
            I was raised in Atlanta, Georgia and was raised here by my mother until I was 7.
            I then had the opportunity to move to Washington with my grandma and did.
            Eventually I ended up feeling homesick so I moving back to atlanta with my mom when I was 13 and I have
            lived in the metro Atlanta area ever since.
            In my free time I love to play video games, learn new recipes and reading.
            My aspiration in life currently is to get a job as a web developer and hopefully be able to do freelance
            work and get into real estate and I am currently working on making my dream into a reality. </p>

    <h2>Why I Love This Show</h2>
    <!-- <ul>The animation in the show is one of the best in any show ive seen. The action scenes are suspensful, each fight is beautifully drawn, and the villans are so well writtin you cant help but love them. </ul> -->
    <ul>Each character has their strength and flaws and their personalitis are very relatable.</ul>
    <ul>The soundtrack is so good I have a bunch of songs from the show saved in my playlist.</ul>
    <ul>The show concept is so original and well written it became one of the pillars of cartoon network.</ul>
    <ul>The show areals to all ages and is still very captivating to me as an adult.(im a little biased tho)</ul>
    <ul>The show features a very diverse cast of characters and pushed the boundries of diversity in cartoons which unfortunatly led to its downfall.</ul>
   
    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <div>
    <p>The diversity in the show is AMAZING!!! The amount of different character and relationship portrayals were truly inspiring and I could talk about all the characters for so long but i really want to highlight one character who was my favorite, GARNET. One of the biggest things Steven Universe was known for was being one of the first few kid's cartoons to feature LGBT characters, who were a huge inspiration for me and tons of other queer kids who just wanted to see someone like them in a cartoon. The character Garnet in the show was a fusion which, you probably don't know what that means but in the show, Garnet is made up of two people. Ruby and Sapphire, who are technically non-binary in the show but used she/her pronouns and were a same-sex couple. Their love was so strong they were able to manifest it into one person. They loved each other so much that they wanted to stay together forever. I know that doesn't make sense and you have to watch the show to get it but, that character was a literal representation of how strong love could be between two people and that was a huge moment in television history for that to be revealed.

    <H2>The Soundtrack</H2>
    <div>
    <p>The soundtrack in the show was absolute perfection. The songs were catchy, each character had a very unique voice, and some of the meanings behind the songs had very important morals behind them. Two of my favorite songs from the show that I would like to highlight are Be Whoever You Are and True Kind of  Love. Both songs express the importance of unapologetically being yourself and not caring what other people have to say about you which really stuck with me as a kid because I used to get bullied a lot and over time it became inspiring and inspired an entire generation of people to do the same.

    <h2>The Diversity</h2>
    <div>
    <p>Rebecca Sugar, the creator of the show, really strived and cared about making a very diverse Cast. When Steven Universe aired we were introduced to a cast of strong and non-binary women who were idolized by the main character. The three characters who fostered the main character were all mothers in their own ways and each portrayed a different relationship with Steven in Waze a bunch of kids could relate to. There was Pearl who was the overprotective, careful mom, Amethyst who was the fun carefree mom, and Garnet who was portrayed as the mom Steven would go to for guidance and would often not be as present as the other parent figures.
